    <h1>Jennifer Cram</h1>
    <article>Hello, my name is Jennifer, but I go by Jenny. I like ot play sports and video games. The sport I play is called ringette and I also goalie coach. My favourite video games are Call of Duty and Assassin’s Creed. I have some experience in Linux because I was in the CST program and left because it wasn’t right for me, but I did learn a lot of valuable things. I also love animals and I have a dog named Riley.</article>
