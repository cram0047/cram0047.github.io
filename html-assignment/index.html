                    <p> 
                        Hello, my name is Jennifer, but I go by Jenny. I like to play sports and video games. The sport I play is called ringette and this will be my 13<sup>th</sup> season playing and my 2<sup>nd</sup> season goalie coaching. My favourite video games are Call of Duty and Assassin’s Creed. I also <em>love</em> animals and I have a dog named Riley, he is a cocker spaniel and poodle mix and he turned 5 at the beginning of September.

                        I have some experience in Linux because I was in the <abbr title="Computer Systems Techniciam">CST</abbr> program and left because it wasn’t right for me, but I did learn a lot of valuable things. In that program I ended up liking Linux the most because it was the most different thing for me to learn and it was challenging. But so far I do like <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> more than the <abbr title="Computer Systems Technician">CST</abbr> program.
                    </p>
