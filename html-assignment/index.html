            <p>Hello, my name is Jennifer, but I go by Jenny. I like ot play sports and video games. The sport I play is called ringette and I also goalie coach. My favourite video games are Call of Duty and Assassin’s Creed. I also love animals and I have a dog named Riley, he is a cocker spaniel and poodle mix and he turned 5 at the beginning of September.</p>
            <p>I have some experience in Linux because I was in the CST program and left because it wasn’t right for me, but I did learn a lot of valuable things. In that programmed I ended up really liking Linux the most because it was the most different thing for me to learn and it was challenging. But so far I do like IMD more.</p>
