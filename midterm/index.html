        <p> Riley is a cockapoo and he is 5 years old. He was born September 2, 2016, and he arrived at his forever home on October 28, 2016. The trip to his new home was roughly 2 hours long and he was a very good boy; he whined for only a couple of minutes at the beginning of the trip and then he settled in and was asleep for the rest of the ride home. As a puppy, he would often be curious and mischievous, wanting to explore everything, as got himself into trouble sometimes. On a cold winter’s day, at only a few months old, went outside for his morning bathroom time, and he found it so cold that he only peed, and when he came inside, he pooped on the carpet. We weren’t mad though because he was only a puppy, and it was very cold outside. Since then, his potty training went smoothly and he had very few accidents in the house. As he got older, he remains mischievous and will help himself to some tissue to tear up. His favourite treats are cheese, dried liver bites, chicken, bell pepper, cucumber, lettuce, and broccoli; he is very healthy. He also really enjoys Christmas and Thanksgiving dinner because he always gets some turkey and a bit of potato, and some unseasoned pumpkin for dessert. In his spare time, he likes to chew on his cheese bones (freeze-dried cheese made from yak’s milk) that he really enjoys, after all, he loves cheese. He was also brought up in his litter to eat when he is hungry, so we always have food out for him, and he eats when he wants. He is an anxious boy and much like his human sister who is writing this, gets anxious from being around strangers, so he needs two people with him to go on his walks. He also loves playing soccer in the backyard, when it's nice out, and he likes to play fetch with his favourite toys inside with all his humans. He also likes to snuggle at all times, except for when he is playing and loves cuddling up under the blankets.  Riley is a very good boy who is very loved and spoiled by his family.
