        <p> Riley is a cockapoo and he is 5 years old. He was born September 2, 2016, and he arrived at his forever home on October 28, 2016. The trip to his new home was roughly 2 hours long and he was a very good boy; he whined for only a couple of minutes at the beginning of the trip and then he settled in and was asleep for the rest of the ride home. As a puppy, he would often be curious and mischievous, wanting to explore everything, as got himself into trouble sometimes. Riley had a few accidents in the house but we didn't get mad though because he was only a puppy, and it was very cold outside. Since then, his potty training went smoothly and he had very few accidents in the house. His favourite treats are cheese, dried liver bites, chicken, bell pepper, cucumber, lettuce, and broccoli; he is very healthy.  In his spare time, he likes to chew on his cheese bones (freeze-dried cheese made from yakâ€™s milk) that he really enjoys, after all, he loves cheese. He was also brought up in his litter to eat when he is hungry, so we always have food out for him, and he eats when he wants. He also likes to snuggle at all times, except for when he is playing and loves cuddling up under the blankets.  Riley is a very good boy who is very loved and spoiled by his family.
